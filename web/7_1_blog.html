<p style="padding:10px;" align="justify">This radio is 24/7 of great music and arrangements of your favorite gospel/worship hymns. The believers in the Church beautifully sing these songs during worship.  Most of the songs are based on the scriptures and intimate one-to-one relationship with Jesus.  Each song delivers a sermon.</p>

<p style="padding:10px;" align="justify">Bro. Bakht Singh first experienced the love and presence of the Lord Jesus Christ when he was an engineering student in Canada in 1929.  Earlier he was opposing Christ and Christianity.  Though he had torn-up the Bible, he has greatly developed an intimate desire and love for the Lord Jesus Christ and had intuition to read and study the Bible. After hearing the Lord's voice and having been convicted of his sinful life, he confessed his sins and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior and dedicated his life in serving Him.  He was India's foremost evangelist, preacher and indigenous church planter who founded churches based on New Testament principles. He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. These songs were graciously provided by Bro. Bakth Singh's co-workers viz. Bro.Lazar Sen, Bro. Jordan Khan, Bro. Martin Sathyanathan, Bro. Moses, Bro. G. John, Br. BJ Paul, many more Saints  who worked for a long time in the service of the Lord with Bro. Bakht Singh.</p>  
<p style="padding:10px;" align="justify">All these songs are still being sung today in Assemblies throughout India.  All these songs are being translated in many Indian languages.  By listening to these songs of Zion you will not only be blessed in addition to that, you will experience the salvation, experience the worship, experience the sermon and feel the Heavenly presence of God.</p>
